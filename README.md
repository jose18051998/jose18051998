- 👋 Hi, I’m @jose18051998
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use new technologies and tools, apply logic and mathematical thinking
to solving problems and developing components to do specific tasks the best possible way.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for a full time job, since I just finished a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics. In
the meantime, I am learning french, giving python lessons to undergraduates and I am doing some coding 
challenges on internet to keep myself in shape.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate developing software on any projects where my background could fit (full stack, data scientist...)
